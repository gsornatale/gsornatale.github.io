          <h2>BUSTY AND THE BASS</h2>
          <h4>The Troubadour - Los Angeles</h4>
          <h4>February 28th, 2018</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="post">
        <p>Busty and the Bass in Los Angeles was a pretty special show.
          One, because the concert was dope… They killed it! Their energy was
          amazing, the crowd danced and they were genuinely excited to be
          performing at the Troubadour for us. But it was important to me because this was
          the first concert that I ever photographed. On top of that, I’ve been
          learning how to code (hence this gorgeous site) and this show was
          finally going to give me something I wanted to kick my digital journal
          off with and make available to the World Wide Web! All my hard work
          was finally coming together and I finally started to weasel my way
          into a creative world I’m really enjoying. Here’s the kicker…. I left
          my camera on the LA 704 westbound bus THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOW! The
          show I’ve been looking forward to for weeks, SO I COULD PHOTOGRAPH IT,
          suddenly went from something that excited the hell out of me, to
          something that made me furious at the world, but mostly myself.</p>
        <p>If you know me, and if I know myself, I leave shit around. So before
          you even start… shut up. I know, it’s a bad habit and I’m working on
          it! I had my face buried in a book called ‘Neverwhere’ (thanks for
          the recommendation, Cameron), the camera was sitting next to me because
          it wouldn’t fit in my bag and I noticed the doors were about to close
          at my stop so I jumped off and didn’t realize I left it until I was
          home. I’m crossing my fingers and putting faith into the universe
          that a kind soul gave the driver a very expensive, meaningful piece
          of equipment they knew was not theirs to keep. Again, finger’s crossed.
          So now what?</p>
        <p>I rented a camera. I couldn’t let the day be ruined by my bullshit.
          A friend pointed out this website called <a href="https://www.ShareGrid.com" target="_blank">ShareGrid</a> where people rent out
          their personal gear for a daily rate. I got pretty much the same camera I once had
          (RIP) and a dope lens (for way more than I wanted to pay) from these
          two awesome guys at <a href="https://www.rarebreedswest.com/" target="_blank">Rare Breeds </a>
          in Santa Monica. They were a huge help in walking me through some things I didn't know
          (which, right now, is pretty much everything). Also, shout out to my friend,
          <a href="https://www.samusilv.com/music" target="_blank">Sam</a>, who
          gave me an amazing 101 to concert photography. I’m excited to get my
          camera back one day and get into a lot more concerts. Photos from the night below.</p>
        <p>Oh, and thanks to Gina, for being my beautiful model while I played
          around with the new equipment.</p>

                    <h2>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</h2>
                    <h3>Kanye West - 2010</h3>
                    <p>It's safe to say I can credit Kanye West for the love of
                    music I have today. When 808s and Heartbreaks dropped, I was hooked.
                    I fell in love with the beats and the overall feel of the albums
                    to the point where I started to become slightly obsessed with his music.
                    I even bought a beat machine and starated to recreate beats Kanye made from old soul music samples.
                    This opened my world of sound up to musical lanes I never thought I'd travel down.
                    </p>
                    <p>My Beautiful Dark Twisted, to me, is his greatest work. It's a perfect
                    blend of "the Old Kanye" and the rather "Experimental Kanye" (he's always been this way) we have today.
                    It received critial accclaim and takes me back to a very specific time of my life.
                    This album really set the tone for what I'd be listening to the next 10 years.</p>

                    <h3>Anderson .Paak - 2016</h3>
                    <p>Malibu started off like the rest of them... an album I simply like
                    because of the sound, lyrics and uniqueness. It wasn't until I saw
                    Anderson .Paak (don't forget that dot) live that this turned into one of those
                    fanboy kinda things. The man is flawless on stage.</p>
                    <p>I was lucky enought to see Anderson .Paak and The Free Nationals at The Palladium
                    in Los Angeles circa December 2016. They instilled in me what is now an obsession for
                    incredible live music experiences - something I chase any moment I get.</p>
